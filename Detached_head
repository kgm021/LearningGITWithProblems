What 
    Head is pointing to commit it rather than a branch
    Any changes that are done in this state are only present as long as we are in the branch
How to get in to Detached head state
    1. When  commit changes are made to repo back to back without PUshing
    2. When history exist in other instance
How to resolve
    git config advice.detached head false

Note:- You can also use the â€“global modifier if you want the change to apply to every repository and not only the current one.
